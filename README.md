# Learn-ML-ZeroToMastery
Contains the conda data and files that I use for the Udemy course ZeroToMastery (no env durectiry).

To create the env use the command :
conda env create --prefix ./env -f enviroment.yml 
where enviroment.yml is the enviroment dependency file

This project contains only the theoretical section of the course, the specific project are in other repository
